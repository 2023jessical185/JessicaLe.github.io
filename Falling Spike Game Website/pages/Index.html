<h1>The Falling Spike Game</h1>
<br>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>My assignment was to create a falling spoike game utilizing Construct 3 and followiing a YouTube Tutorial.
    The process took about a week or so to complete and finalize the game. Although I came across a few difficulties
    here and there, I still managed to finish the game.The goal of this game is for the players to have fun and enjoy!</p>
<br>
    <h3>How to Play!</h3>
<p>The concept of the game is to try to avoid the falling spikes from the sky(hints the name).
    To do so, you must use your computer mouse to move from one side to the other, If the spikes
    pass you without coming in contact with your player, the score will then continue to increase.
    But if the spikes even slightly graze the player, the game will then immediately end. Resulting 
    in the "Game Over" page, it'll give you the options to go back to the homepage or play again.</p>
